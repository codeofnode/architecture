# Steps for a release
- A release happens whenever we are about to raise a pr from vx.y.z to vx.y.
- this release includes all the features and bugs fixes for which we have branches vx.y.z-*
- above should already been created in TODO.md
- we move all these vx.y.z-* from TODO.md (also empty the todo version block if not issues for that version left in todo.md) to changelog.md, dated as current date
- change / inc version info in package.json
- commit it, and push it to githost.
- raise a pr raise a pr from vx.y.z to vx.y
- merge the pr.
- in usual cases, also merge vx.y into vx and then vx into master
