> Some opinions on how to setup architecture for a software product.

## The opinions

### Only one repository
> There should only be one repository corresponding to a main product. There should be a different number of build process for each kind of supplimentary/complementry application plugin etc. One build process should be reponsible to build the app and test and ship automatically.
